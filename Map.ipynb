    "## How to produce a map\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface below allows you to setup several parametres, such as data layers, format, DPI etc., or you can use the dafult settings (*the baseamap with provinces in 117 AD styled in colour, with roman roads and cities, PNG format with 300 DPI*).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First of all, go to the `Kernel` menu from the top bar of this Notebook and choose `Restart & Run All Cells` for the map interface to load properly.**\n",
    "1. Go to the *Export Map interface*, click to the **Update Data File List** button to update the list with latest searches. Then select the desired **Data file** in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "1. **Map Title**: You can provide your map with a title of your choosing. If you leave the field empty the search *Text 1* parametres will be used instead.\n",
    "1. Choose the **Basemap** corresponding the best with the spatial distribution of Roman probinces in a chronological period you wish to show. The default Basemap represents the highest extent of the Roman Empire in  117 AD.\n",
    "1. **Show Provinces**: You can choose whether you want to show on your map All Provinces, or only those containing at least one inscription. The default displays All Provinces.\n",
    "1. **Basemap Styling** allows you to style your map in *Light Brown* or *Multicolour*. The default uses the Multicolour settings.\n",
    "1. If you wish to publish your map in greyscale, tick the box **Greyscale map**. However, in that case we recommend using a different (i.e. less busy) basemap or remove roads and cities.\n",
    "1. **Show Roads**: You can choose whether you want to show on your map All Roman Roads, or only those in the vicinity of at least one inscription, or no roads. The default displays All Roman Roads.\n",
    "1. **Show Cities**: You can choose whether you want to show on your map All Cities, or only those in the vicinity of at least one inscription, or no cities. The default displays All Cities.\n",
    "1. **Filetype**: You can specify the file format the map should have. You can choose between PNG, TIFF, EPS, SVG and PDF format, or PDF with the metadata of inscriptions appended to it. The default format is PNG.\n",
    "1. **Label with Inscription IDs**: Tick this box if you wish to label all inscriptions with their IDs. *WARNING*: if you have more than few tens of inscriptions, the map can get extremely busy and illegible on an Epire-wide scale.\n",
    "1. **DPI**: You can set the DPI for your map. You can choose between 72, 300, 600, and 1200 DPI. The default is 300 DPI.\n",
    "1. **Marker size for inscriptions**: you can choose the size of the inscription markers (1, 5, 10, 20), with 5 being the default value.\n",
    "1. **Citation**: you can toggle between two options. The first one removes the citation from the map, the second one keeps it in. If you decide to remove the citation, we urge you to cite in the text of your research output for the sake of research transparency, integrity and as a mean of academic recognition for our efforts. \n",
